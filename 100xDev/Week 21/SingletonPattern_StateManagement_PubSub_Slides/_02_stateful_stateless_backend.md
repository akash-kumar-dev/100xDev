Common interview question

Usually when you write HTTP servers, they dont hold any `state`

This means, they donâ€™t have any in memory variables that they use

They usually rely on the `database` for `state`

1.  Users can connect to a random server, there is no need of stickiness

2.  Can autoscale up and down easily and simply decide where to route traffic based on CPU usage.

A lot of times, you make servers hold `state` Good examples of this are

1.  Creating an `in memory cache` - [https://github.com/code100x/cms/blob/e905c71eacf9d99f68db802b24b7b3a924ae27f1/src/db/Cache.ts#L3](https://github.com/code100x/cms/blob/e905c71eacf9d99f68db802b24b7b3a924ae27f1/src/db/Cache.ts#L3)

2.  Storing the `state` of a Game in case of a realtime game - [https://github.com/code100x/chess/blob/main/apps/ws/src/Game.ts#L41-L47](https://github.com/code100x/chess/blob/main/apps/ws/src/Game.ts#L41-L47)

3.  Storing a list of 10 most latest chats in memory for a `chat` application

In case `1`, there is no need of `stickiness`

In case of `2` and `3`, there is need of `stickiness`

Making sure that the user who is interested in a `specific` room, gets connected to a `specific` server.

Good question to ask at this point is - How to store state in a JS project?

How/where can you store `state` in a Javascript process

This state might being used by multiple files, not just one, so the following approach might not work

Lets try the following -

*   index.ts - pushes to games array

```javascript
import { games } from "./store";
import { startLogger } from "./logger";

startLogger();

setInterval(() => {
    games.push({
        "whitePlayer": "harkirat",
        "blackPlayer": "jaskirat",
        moves: []
    })
}, 5000)
```

*   logger.ts - uses the games array

```javascript
import { games } from "./store";

export function startLogger() {
    setInterval(() => {
        console.log(games);
    }, 4000)
}
```

*   store.ts - Exports the game array

```javascript
interface Game {
    whitePlayer: string;
    blackPlayer: string;
    moves: string[];
}

export const games: Game[] = [];
```

This will work, but a lot of times you need to attach functionality to `state` as well.

Letâ€™s see how can we create a class called `GameManager` and expose some functions on it that can be called by files using it

There are other ways of storing state in a TS project as well, redux being a popular one. Yes, you can use redux in the backend as well

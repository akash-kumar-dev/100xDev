Step 6 - Images vs containers
=============================

**Docker Image**

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

A good mental model for an image is `Your codebase on github`

**Docker Container**

A container is a running instance of an image. It encapsulates the application or service and its dependencies, running in an isolated environment.

ðŸ’¡

A good mental model for a container is when you run `node index.js` on your machine from some source code you got from github

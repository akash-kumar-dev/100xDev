As an application/full stack developer, you need to be comfortable with the following terminologies -

1.  Docker Engine

2.  Docker CLI - Command line interface

3.  Docker registry

###

Docker Engine is an open-source `containerization` technology that allows developers to package applications into `container`

Containers are standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

###

The command line interface lets you talk to the `docker engine` and lets you start/stop/list containers

    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo

ðŸ’¡

Docker cli is not the only way to talk to a docker engine. You can hit the docker `REST` API to do the same things

#### 

[](#dddc0ac42a674e27b29efc75e5756886 "3. Docker registry")3\. Docker registry

The `docker registry` is how Docker makes money.

It is similar to `github`, but it lets you push `images` rather than `sourcecode`

Dockerâ€™s main registry - [https://dockerhub.com/](https://dockerhub.com/)

Mongo image on docker registry - [https://hub.docker.com/\_/mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)

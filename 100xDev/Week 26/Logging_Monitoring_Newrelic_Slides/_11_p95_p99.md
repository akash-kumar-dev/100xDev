# p95, p99

When you are measuring things like `response times` , `cpu usage` etc, which of the following should you use?

1.  Mean

2.  Median

3.  Something else?

Let’s say in a 20 second interval there were 20 requests that came and the response times were -

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13, 13, 13, 50, 100]
```

**Average - 14.45**

**Median - 9.5**

As you can see, the average is skewed a little to the right because of two anomolies (50, 100)

This means the website is performing good for 90% of the users, but 10% of the users are having slower response times.

*   P90 here is 13, since 90% of the users are equal to or below 13ms

Can you guess what P95 would be?

P95 is 50, since 95% of the users are equal to or below 50ms

If you open the APM dashboard, you’ll see the response time percentiles tab

Try exploring the query -

```javascript
SELECT percentile(duration, 95) * 1000, 
percentile(duration, 99) * 1000,
median(duration * 1000) as Median,
average(duration * 1000) as Average
FROM Transaction
WHERE (entityGuid = 'NDQ2MDY2NXxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NTY0ODg2NzU5')
AND (transactionType = 'Web')
LIMIT MAX SINCE 1800 seconds AGO EXTRAPOLATE TIMESERIES 
```

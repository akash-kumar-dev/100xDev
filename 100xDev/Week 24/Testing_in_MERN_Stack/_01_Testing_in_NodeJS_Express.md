# Testing in Node.js + Express

One of the core things to do while writing your code is testing it.

It’s highly ignored in most codebases but we’re going to try to get close to how testing happens in MERN stack codebases

Goal would be to understand

1.  How to test an express backend

2.  Mocking, spying, jest, vitest

3.  Unit tests vs integration tests vs end to end tests

4.  How to integrate testing and coverage in CI/CD

# Mocking dependencies

Ref - [https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html)

When writing `unit tests` , you `mock out` all `external service` calls.

This means you test the `core` of your logic, and assume the `database calls` would succeed.

This is done so tests can run without starting a `database` / `external services`

Mocking, as the name suggests, means `mocking` the behaviour of a file/class/variable when tests are running.

To mock out the `prismaClient`, you can add the following code to the top of `index.test.ts`

```javascript
vi.mock('../db', () => ({
  prismaClient: { sum: { create: vi.fn() }}
}));
```

Since we know we are only calling

```javascript
prismaClient.sum.create
```

I have `mocked` the implementation of that function. A `mock` does nothing and returns `undefined` when the function call succeeds.

Try running `npm run test` now. It should succeed

Can you guess the two problems that exist here? 1. What if I want to use the value that the database call returns? Right now, it will return `undefined` while a real DB call would return some real data 2. I have to constantly keep upgrading the `mock` since in the future I might use the `findOne` function, then might add a new table called `users` â€¦

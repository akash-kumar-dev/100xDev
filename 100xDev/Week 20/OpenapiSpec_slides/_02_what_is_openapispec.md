# What is the OpenAPI Spec

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code, additional documentation, or network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with minimal implementation logic.

Developed initially by Swagger, and later donated to the OpenAPI Initiative under the Linux Foundation, the OpenAPI Specification has become a widely adopted industry standard for defining and using APIs.

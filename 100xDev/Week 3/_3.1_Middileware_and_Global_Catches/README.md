# Week 3.1: Middlewares, Global Catches, and Input Validation

## Middlewares

Middlewares are functions that run between the request and the response in a web application. They can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request and response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware in the stack

Middlewares are crucial for adding functionality to your application without modifying the core request handling logic.

## Global Catches

Global catches, also known as error handling middleware, are used to catch and handle errors that occur anywhere in the application. They help in:

- Centralizing error handling logic
- Providing consistent error responses
- Logging errors for debugging purposes

Implementing global catches ensures that your application gracefully handles unexpected errors and doesn't crash.

## Input Validation with Zod

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It's used for input validation in web applications to ensure that the data received from clients meets the expected format and constraints.

Key features of Zod include:

- TypeScript support
- Rich validation rules
- Automatic type inference
- Easy integration with Express.js and other frameworks

Using Zod for input validation helps in:

- Preventing invalid data from entering your application
- Improving application security
- Reducing the need for manual data checking in your route handlers

By implementing these concepts, you can create more robust, secure, and maintainable web applications.

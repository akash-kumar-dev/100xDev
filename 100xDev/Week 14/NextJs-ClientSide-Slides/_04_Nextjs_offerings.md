# Step 4 - Next.js offerings

Next.js provides you the following `upsides` over React

1.  Server side rendering - Get’s rid of SEO problems

2.  API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend

3.  File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)

4.  Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation

5.  Maintained by the Vercel team

Downsides -

1.  Can’t be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does `server side rendering` and hence is expensive

2.  Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it

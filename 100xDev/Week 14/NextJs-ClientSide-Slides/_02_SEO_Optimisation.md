# Step 2 - SEO Optimisation

Google/Bing has a bunch of `crawlers` that hit websites and figure out what the website does.

It ranks it on `Google` based on the HTML it gets back

The crawlers `DONT` usually run your JS and render your page to see the final output.

Googlebot has no idea on what the project is. It only sees `Vite + React + TS` in the original HTML response.

Ofcourse when the JS file loads eventually, things get rendered but the `Googlebot` doesnâ€™t discover this content very well.

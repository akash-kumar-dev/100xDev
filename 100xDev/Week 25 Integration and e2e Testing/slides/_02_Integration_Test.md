# Integration tests

While `unit tests` are great, they mock out a lot of external services (DB, cache, message queues â€¦). This is great for testing the functionality of a function in isolation.

Integration tests are used to test how all `integrated components` work together.

This means you have to start all auxilary services before running your tests and you `DONT` mock out any external service calls

# Why WebRTC?

WebRTC is the core/only protocol that lets you do `real time media communication` from inside a browser.

We already did this fairly well in a live stream

You use WebRTC for applications that require sub second latency.

Examples include

1.  Zoom/Google meet (Multi party call)

2.  Omegle, teaching (1:1 call)

3.  30FPS games (WebRTC can also send data)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Asynchronous Data Queries in Recoil

Recoil selectors provide a powerful way to handle asynchronous data in your React applications:

1. What are selectors?
- They are pure functions that transform state data
- Can be thought of as "derived state" - state calculated from other state
- Act like getters that can combine multiple atoms/selectors

2. Async Capabilities:
- Can return promises instead of direct values
- Perfect for API calls and data fetching
- Automatically handle loading/error states
- Cache results by default

3. Common Use Cases:
- Fetching data from APIs
- Complex calculations that take time
- Database queries
- File operations

4. Benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Built-in concurrency handling
- Seamless integration with React Suspense

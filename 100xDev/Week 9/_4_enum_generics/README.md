### Enums
Enums (short for enumerations) in TypeScript are features that allows you to define a set of named constants.
The concepts behind the enumerations is to create a human-readable way to represent a set of contstant values, which might otherwise be represented by numbers or strings.

### Generics
generics are a way to create reusable components that can work with different types of data.
- typescript is not able to infer the right type of retturn data.
- generics enable you to create components that work with any data type while still providing compile-time type safety.

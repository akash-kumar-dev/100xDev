Cookies in web development are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. They are designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember things (very similar to local storage)

1.  **Session Management:** Cookies allow websites to identify users and track their individual session states across multiple pages or visits.

2.  **Personalization:** Websites use cookies to personalize content and ads. For instance, cookies might store information about a user's preferences, allowing the site to tailor content or advertisements to those interests.

3.  **Tracking:** Cookies can track users across websites, providing insights into browsing behavior. This information can be used for analytics purposes, to improve website functionality, or for advertising targeting.

4.  **Security:** Secure cookies can be used to enhance the security of a website by ensuring that the transmission of information is only done over an encrypted connection, helping to prevent unauthorized access to user data.

We will be focussing on point `4`

Cookies and LocalStorage both provide ways to store data on the client-side, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.

1.  Cookies are send with every request to the website (by the browser) (you donâ€™t have to explicitly add a header to the fetch call) This point becomes super important in Next.js, weâ€™ll see later why

1.  Cookies can have an expiry attached to them

2.  Cookies can be be restricted to only `https` and to certain `domains`

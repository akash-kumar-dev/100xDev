Why cant I just store services (backend, frontend etc) in various top level folders?

You can, and you should if your

1.  Services are highly decoupled (dont share any code)

2.  Services donâ€™t depend on each other.

For eg - A codebase which has a Golang service and a JS service

1.  **Shared Code Reuse**

2.  **Enhanced Collaboration**

3.  **Optimized Builds and CI/CD**: Tools like TurboRepo offer smart caching and task execution strategies that can significantly reduce build and testing times.

4.  **Centralized Tooling and Configuration**: Managing build tools, linters, formatters, and other configurations is simpler in a monorepo because you can have a single set of tools for the entire project.

# Asymetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The keys are mathematically related, but it is computationally infeasible to derive the `private key` from the `public key`.

**Public Key**: The public key is a string that can be shared openly

**Private Key**: The private key is a secret cryptographic code that must be kept confidential. It is used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key or to create digital signatures.

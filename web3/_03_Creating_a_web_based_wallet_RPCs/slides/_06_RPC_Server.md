An RPC server provides a way for external clients to interact with the blockchain network. RPC stands for **Remote Procedure Call**, and an RPC server exposes an API that allows clients to send requests and receive responses from the blockchain.

An RPC server is a service that listens for JSON-RPC requests from clients, processes these requests, and returns the results. It acts as an intermediary between the blockchain and external applications or services.

An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server is not inherently part of the blockchain network itself, nor does it participate in staking or consensus mechanisms

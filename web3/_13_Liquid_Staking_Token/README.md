# Liquid Staking Token

An **LST**, or **liquid staking token**, is a type of token that represents a user's staked assets in a **proof-of-stake** blockchain. When you stake your cryptocurrency, you often cannot access or trade it while it’s staked. **Liquid staking** allows you to maintain liquidity while still participating in the staking process.

### 1. Staking
When you stake your cryptocurrency with a liquid staking provider, you receive an equivalent amount of **LSTs** in return. These tokens represent your staked assets.

### 2. Liquidity
Since **LSTs** can be traded or used in other **decentralized finance (DeFi)** applications, you can take advantage of market opportunities while your original assets remain staked.

### 3. Earning rewards
While holding **LSTs**, you still earn staking rewards on the underlying assets, typically reflected in the value of the **LST**.


## Indexer
Something that scans every block/txn in the blockchain and you can subscribe to events on it.
Events can be things like:
1. Function has been called on a program
2. SOL has been transferred to an address
3. USDT/USDC/Custom token has been transferred to an address

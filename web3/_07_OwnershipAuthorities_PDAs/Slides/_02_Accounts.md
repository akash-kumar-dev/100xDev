# Accounts

Ref - [https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts)

On Solana, all data is stored in what are referred to as "accounts‚Äù. The way data is organized on Solana resembles a¬†[key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database), where each entry in the database is called an "account".

*   Accounts can store up to 10MB of data, which can consist of either executable program code or program state.

*   Programs (smart contracts) are stateless accounts that store executable code.
*   Data accounts are created by programs to store and manage program state.

*   Accounts require a rent deposit in SOL, proportional to the amount of data stored, which is fully refundable when the account is closed.

*   Every account has a program `owner`. Only the program that owns an account can modify its data or deduct its lamport balance. However, anyone can increase the balance.

*   Native programs are built-in programs included with the Solana runtime.

Each account is identifiable by its unique address, represented as 32 bytes in the format of an¬†[Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)¬†`PublicKey`. You can think of the address as the unique identifier for the account.

Accounts have a¬†[max size of 10MB](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/27eff8408b7223bb3c4ab70523f8a8dca3ca6645/sdk/program/src/system_instruction.rs#L85)¬†(10 Mega Bytes) and the data stored on every account on Solana has the following structure known as the¬†[AccountInfo](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/27eff8408b7223bb3c4ab70523f8a8dca3ca6645/sdk/program/src/account_info.rs#L19).

Even if you store not data, you have to store fields like `executable` and `owner` which is why you still have to have a minimum amount of SOL as rent `solana rent 0`

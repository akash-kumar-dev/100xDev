# Creating an Token

Program - [https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap)

There are a few steps if you ever want to create your own token on Solana and make it tradeable (let people buy and sell it).

- Create your own token

- Create a `liquidity pool` for your token

- Add `liquidity` of both the tokens

- Wait for people to trade on that pool

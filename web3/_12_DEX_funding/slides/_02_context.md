**Poll** – How many of you are actually coding?

**Project idea** – SEND FOMO

Things left to do before we start contracts:
1. NFTs on Solana  
2. Token Extensions on Solana  

Until now, we’ve understood liquidity pools and AMMs.  
We haven’t yet created a liquidity pool ourselves.

In today’s class, we’ll be creating a liquidity pool ourselves.

There are a lot of permissionless `DEXs` on Solana.  
We’ll be using `Raydium` to do `low level swaps` (create liquidity pools for our own tokens).

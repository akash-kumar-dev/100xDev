# How to create a new currency?

Right now, currencies can only be issued by central governments. You canâ€™t create your own `Kirat coin` and ask users to use it.

Even if I do issue a `Kirat coin` , no one would use it, and for good reasons -

1.  I can print any number of Kirat coins, making myself richer

2.  I become the central mint and verification athority for the coin.

3.  No one would (or should) trust me

# Things to do

Once a user connects to your `dapp`, you usually ask the user to do a few things with their wallet balance -

1.  Request Airdrop

2.  Show SOL balances (GET data from the blockchain)

3.  Send a transaction (Send a transaction to the blockchain)

4.  Sign a message (Verify the ownership of the wallet)
